# Physics Notes I didn't took

## Description

This project is a collection of notes I didn't took during my AP physics classes. 
It's intend to help those who are struggling to understand their teachers and explain the concepts in the planes way possible.
It would be the goal to make the notes as complete as possible so that it can help as many students as possible. 
Each folder has its own LaTeX file that can be compiled to a PDF file. And the completed PDF file is also available in the folder.


## Installation

You may chose to access these notes in the PDF folder or compile it through a Latex editor.

## Usage

Help students to understand the concepts of physics in a more plane way.
