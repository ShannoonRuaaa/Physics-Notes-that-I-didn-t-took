\section{Momentum}
Assuming you are at an inertial frame of reference, an object's momentum relative to you is $mv$. A change in an object's momentum is:
$$\Delta L = m \Delta v$$
A change in momentum must be caused by an outside force because of the second equation in kinematics ($\Delta v = a\Delta t$).

So when the acceleration is constant
